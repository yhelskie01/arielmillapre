            <p><space>______</space>I am a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science, eager to apply my technical skills and knowledge to solve real-world challenges. Throughout my academic journey, I have gained hands-on experience in programming languages like HTML, CSS, and Java, and have developed a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles. 

                In addition to my coursework, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from web development to machine learning, where I honed my ability to work both independently and as part of a team. I am passionate about technology and continuously seek opportunities to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.
                
                I am excited to contribute my skills in coding, problem-solving, and analytical thinking to innovative projects and am eager to collaborate with others in creating impactful solutions.
